    "Seasonal forecasts provide a long-range outlook of changes in the Earth system over periods of a few weeks or months. Seasonal forecasts are different from weather forecasts, which give a lot more precise detail - both in time and space - of the evolution of the state of the atmosphere over a few days into the future. Beyond a few days, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere limits the possibility to predict precise changes at local scales. This is one of the reasons long-range forecasts of atmospheric conditions have large uncertainties. To quantify such uncertainties, long-range forecasts use `ensembles`, and meaningful forecast products reflect distributions of outcomes.\n",
