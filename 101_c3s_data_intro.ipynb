    "Seasonal forecasts provide a long-range outlook of changes in the Earth system over periods of a few weeks or months. Seasonal forecasts are different from weather forecasts, which give a lot more precise detail - both in time and space - of the evolution of the state of the atmosphere over a few days into the future. Beyond a few days, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere limits the possibility to predict precise changes at local scales. This is one of the reasons long-range forecasts of atmospheric conditions have large uncertainties. To quantify such uncertainties, long-range forecasts use `ensembles`, and meaningful forecast products reflect distributions of outcomes.\n",

    "The C3S seasonal forecast products are based on data from several state-of-the-art seasonal prediction systems. Multi-system combinations, as well as predictions from the individual participating systems, are available. The centres currently providing forecasts to C3S are: ECMWF, The Met Office and Météo-France, Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), and you can find a description of the C3S seasonal multi-system [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Description+of+the+C3S+seasonal+multi-system) and a summary of available data for each system [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Summary+of+available+data).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The role of hindcasts\n",
    "Seasonal forecasts are started from an observed state of (all components of) the climate system, which is then evolved in time over a period of a few months. Errors present at the start of the forecast (due to the imprecise measurement of the initial conditions and the approximations assumed in the formulation of the models) persist or, more often, grow through the model integration. Some errors are random, some errors, however, are systematic. If these systematic errors were determined, corrections could be applied to the forecasts to extract the useful information. This is achieved by comparing retrospective forecasts (reforecasts or `hindcasts`) with observations. By building the average of the `hindcasts`, you can identify a 'climate' (average over a reference period, e.g 1993 to 2016) of the model, which can then be compared with the observed climate of the real world. The systematic differences between the model and the real world - usually referred to as `biases` - are thus quantified and used as the basis for corrections which can be applied to future, real-time forecasts.  Given the relative magnitude of such biases, some basic corrections are essential to convert the data into forecast information - therefore a forecast by itself is not useful without relating it to the relevant hindcasts.
