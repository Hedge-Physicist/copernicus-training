# Jupyter notebook tutorials for C3S and CAMS
This repository contains Jupyter notebook training material for the [Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)](https://climate.copernicus.eu/) and the [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/). Some notebooks were produced for specific training events, but all can be used as standalone tutorials. Below is a description of each notebook, listed in reverse chronological order. Each description includes a high level outline of the training content and objectives, describing the tools and data presented. If a notebook was developed for a particular training event, this event is also described. At the end of each description are links to run the notebook in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index) and to view a rendered version in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

## 2021-09-CAMS-Air-Quality-Data-Access
### Tutorial on access and visualisation of CAMS global forecast and reanalysis data
Jupyter notebook tutorial that demonstrates how to access CAMS global atmospheric composition forecasts and CAMS global reanalysis data, using the Atmosphere Data Store (ADS) API. It also shows how to use Python to create basic visualisations.

The tutorial was developed for a training event in September 2021 entitled, "Introduction and Access to Global Air Quality Forecasting Data and Tools". The event was organised together with the NASA Applied Remote Sensing Training (ARSET) Program. Please see more detials on this event **[here.](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/arset-introduction-and-access-global-air-quality-forecasting-data-and)**

## 2021-02-Copernicus-ECMWF-data-tutorial
### Tutorial on access and processing of C3S and CAMS data
Jupyter notebook tutorial that provides step by step instructions on how to access C3S and CAMS data from the various catalogues; how to carry-out basic processing, such as calculation of climatology and anomalies; and how to visualise the data in plots. The data includes C3S ERA5 reanalysis data of soil moisture, CAMS European Air Quality Forecast data for dust and PM10, and CAMS Global Near-Real-Time data for total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD).

The tutorial was developed for a training event to data journalists on 23 February 2021.
