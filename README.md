### Tutorial on access and processing of C3S and CAMS data
Jupyter notebook tutorial that provides step by step instructions on how to access C3S and CAMS data from the various catalogues; how to carry-out basic processing, such as calculation of climatology and anomalies; and how to visualise the data in plots. The data includes C3S ERA5 reanalysis data of soil moisture, CAMS European Air Quality Forecast data for dust and PM10, and CAMS Global Near-Real-Time data for total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD).

The tutorial was developed for a training event to data journalists on 23 February 2021.

### Tutorial on access and visualisation of CAMS global forecast and reanalysis data
Jupyter notebook tutorial that demonstrates how to access CAMS global atmospheric composition forecasts and CAMS global reanalysis data, using the Atmosphere Data Store (ADS) API. It also shows how to use Python to create basic visualisations.

The tutorial was developed for a training event in September 2021 entitled, "Introduction and Access to Global Air Quality Forecasting Data and Tools". The event was organised together with the NASA Applied Remote Sensing Training (ARSET) Program.
