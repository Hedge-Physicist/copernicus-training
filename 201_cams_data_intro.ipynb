This dataset provides annual air quality reanalyses for Europe based on both unvalidated (interim) and validated observations. An interim reanalysis is provided each year for the year before based on the unvalidated near-real-time observation data stream that has not undergone full quality control by the data providers yet. Once the fully quality-controlled observations are available from the data provider, typically with an additional delay of about 1 year, a final validated annual reanalysis is provided. Both reanalyses are available at hourly time steps at height levels.
